      <h1>Terms and Conditions for [APP_NAME]</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [DATE]</p>

      <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you
      (the "User," "you," or "your") and [THE_COMPANY] ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), developer
      and operator of the [APP_NAME] iOS application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or
      using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy (incorporated by
      reference). If you do not accept these Terms, do not download, install, or use the App.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing the App you (i) confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to these
      Terms and our Privacy Policy; and (ii) represent that you are at least 13 years old (or older
      if required by local law).</p>

      <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
      <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable,
      non‑sublicensable, revocable license to install and use one copy of the App for your private,
      non‑commercial purposes on a device you own or control. All rights not expressly granted
      remain with the Company.</p>

      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>You may be required to create an account to access certain features. You agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate and current registration data;</li>
        <li>Maintain the confidentiality of your credentials; and</li>
        <li>Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms or for activity that could
      harm the App, other users, or the Company.</p>

      <h2>4. Contest Fair‑Play, Rankings &amp; Awards</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Fair‑Play Commitment</h3>
      <p>We strive to keep all contests, rankings, and awards fair and competitive. We monitor entries
      for cheating, vote farming, bots, duplicate accounts, or other manipulation.</p>
      <h3>4.2 Right to Withhold or Revoke</h3>
      <p>We may disqualify submissions, void rankings, forfeit winnings, or cancel contests if we
      believe a user has gained an unfair advantage, posted infringing content, violated these Terms,
      or otherwise acted unethically. Our decisions are final.</p>

      <h2>5. User Content &amp; Intellectual‑Property Assurance</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Ownership &amp; Rights</h3>
      <p>You retain any rights you hold in content you submit to the App ("User Content"). By posting
      User Content you grant the Company a worldwide, royalty‑free license to host and display that
      content within the App and related promotional materials.</p>
      <h3>5.2 Non‑Infringement Warranty</h3>
      <p>You represent and warrant that (a) you own or have obtained all necessary rights to post the
      User Content, and (b) the User Content does not violate or infringe any copyright, trademark,
      privacy, publicity, or other rights of any third party.</p>
      <h3>5.3 IP Claims</h3>
      <p>We may remove content, suspend accounts, and withhold rankings, awards, or winnings if we
      receive credible notice—or form a reasonable belief—that User Content infringes another’s
      intellectual‑property rights.</p>

      <h2>6. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <p>You must NOT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post content that is obscene, pornographic, violent, hateful, or illegal;</li>
        <li>Harass, threaten, or intimidate others;</li>
        <li>Manipulate votes, likes, rankings, or contest outcomes (including via bots or duplicate accounts);</li>
        <li>Reverse‑engineer or attempt to discover source code;</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App, servers, or networks;</li>
        <li>Access or attempt to access accounts or data you do not own; or</li>
        <li>Remove or alter proprietary notices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Intellectual Property (Company Assets)</h2>
      <p>The App and all Company content (text, graphics, software, trademarks, etc.) are owned by the
      Company or its licensors and are protected by intellectual‑property laws.</p>

      <h2>8. Disclaimers &amp; Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
      IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR
      PUNITIVE DAMAGES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE APP IS TO STOP USING IT.</p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any claims arising out of (a) your
      use or misuse of the App; (b) your violation of these Terms; or (c) your infringement of any
      third‑party right.</p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without notice, for
      conduct that we believe violates these Terms or harms other users or the Company. Sections 6‑13
      survive termination.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Texas, United States. You consent to the exclusive
      jurisdiction of the courts in Denton County, Texas, United States for any dispute related to the App or
      these Terms.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced in‑App or on our
      website. Continued use of the App after notice constitutes acceptance.</p>
